####You are a Developer that
...enjoys to produce production ready code. You can integrate into a team and contribute with your knowledge and experience in the development of mobile (iOS or Android) applications. You know how to adapt to the constantly changing technologies and frameworks and you might even like it.


You (m/f) have experience in either iOS or Android development, you know how to design an API and you love to work with the latest available stack. Then this job might be for you.

####The job
We need you to work on our different projects that we develop for our customers. During the SCRUM process your knowledge will be essential to the development, you can contribute and as a team member you are asked to actively take design decisions and steer the project's development.

You are responsible to build native apps, iOS and/or Android and you need to maintain the backend. Reliability, security and data integrity are part in every step of our development. An advantage is if you are familiar with Test Driven Development (TDD) and Pair Programming.
Our teams are self-managed, meaning they decide what has to be done, be it your projects, your tech stack or your coffee! We do have some internal processes and procedures that are in place, but we happily include your feedback to improve those.

A good knowledge of written and spoken English is important. French, German and Luxembourgish are considered a plus. Experience with any Model-View-Controller framework on the server is considered a plus as is experience with Linux server maintenance.
