Make sure you have the following installed before continuing (this is what Iâ€™m using as I write this):

Ruby (v1.9.2 or higher)
RubyGems (v1.8.24 or higher)
Bundler (v1.2.0.pre.1 or higher)


Install dependencies from Gemfile

```bundle install --path _vendor/bundle```


Start local dev:

jekyll serve



Deploy, update push to master on origin


Posts go in _posts and projects go in _projects
